    "# Bike Share Analysis in Python\n",

I got to apply the skills I learned from the course and experienced first hand how data can impact decisions. Working on the project allowed me to develop a strong foundation with R including how to wrangle, clean, and visualize data. \n",

    "\n",
    "Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago with a fleet of 5,824 geotracked bicycles and a network of 692 stations. They offer 3 pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders and customers who purchase annual memberships are referred to as Cyclistic members. The company determined that annual members are more profitable than casual riders and is aiming to create a marketing campaign to maximize the number of annual members by converting casual riders.\n",
